# If-you-had-the-opportunity
Money and banks have controlled the world for hundreds of years, with Constelation I believe we now have the opportunity to change that.
I believe we are the Internet of Things, I am interested in creating community based county driven not for profit cooperatives in the areas
of finance, insurance, transportation, employment, housing, cable, cellular, food, child and health care.
What we do with our attention drives markets, what we sign creates wealth if we forcused on providing for our futures I estimate we would 
create a fund of over $160 tillion the first year.
